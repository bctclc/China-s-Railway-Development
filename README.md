1. Data files

"raw data" contains raw data (as its name suggests:P). Seriously, it contains the departing times and arriving times, as well as the exact sources. The "note" column is for cities that were not directly connected to Beijing, either unconnected completely, or for some cities, at least one transfer is needed. 

"matrix" only contains travel times from Beijing to these cities by year and region.

2. How do we decide which train to choose?

There are often multiple trains that travel between Beijing and these cities. We chose the fastest direct train if possible. If not, the fastest indirect way.

3. How do we decide which years to present?

The time range is clear from the very beginning, 1949 when P.R.China was founded to now. Then we tried to find out the years when changes happened. The six large-scale speedups were included for sure, and these years are 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2007. Then it was 2012, the year after the speed limit 300km/h. 2016 was chosen as a comparison to what happened after this time's speedup.

As for years before 1997, we used ten years as an interval and tried to get 1987, 1977, 1967, and 1957. And because we couldn't find the schedule book for 1957, we used 1959 as an alternative.  

4. Where did we get the sources?

Shanghai library and online second-hand bookstore.
